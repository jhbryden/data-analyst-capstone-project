My capstone project for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate that was completed in February 2024. The entire process from start to finish is included in the file.  

- Included in the process were API, data exploring, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and web scraping to clean and prepare the data via Jupyter Notebook.
- Python and SQL were used to obtain the information for charts and graphs.
- IBM Cognos was used to create the dashboards.
- Microsoft PowerPoint was used to explain and show visuals of the results.
